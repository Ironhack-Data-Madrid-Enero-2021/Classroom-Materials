    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis is an important topic in analytics that rarely receives the coverage it deserves. As the name implies, it was originally developed to quantify and measure the lifespans of individuals (how likely someone was to die or survive). For example, if you wanted to know what the probability of death over time was for a certain a group of people who had contracted some illness, you would use survival analysis. However, the techniques used in survival analysis can be applied to a wide variety of situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to cover the basics of survival analysis so that you can leverage this valuable set of techniques in analyses that you conduct going forward. To do this, we will need to install a new Python library called lifelines that is specifically used for conducting survival analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ pip install lifelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We will import the components of lifelines a little later as we need them. We are also going to be using Pandas in this lesson as well as Plotly and Cufflinks, so let's go ahead and import those."

    "# Survival Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Survival analysis can be performed on various scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Estimating human lifespans\n",
    "    Estimating mechanical failures over time\n",
    "    Estimating length of customer retention\n",
    "    Estimating time to recovery for illnesses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are certain requirements for conducting a survival analysis. The first of these is that you need to have a field in your data that represents the occurrence (or lack thereof) of an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second requirement is that you need to have a field that represents the passage of time in some fashion. This can be datetimes or it can be a number that increases with the passage of time, such as number of days/weeks/months/years, the number of uses, distance traveled, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and final requirement is that you need to have at least one field to group by. Survival analysis calculates the survival rates for groups that something in common. The group by field is the thing they have in common. If you have multiple fields you can group by, you can perform the analysis for the groups represented by each field individually or you can combine them into more granular segments and examine the survival rates of those. However, you can only do this up to a point where the number of examples in a group become too few to reliably calculate their survival rates. So you need to balance the ability drill down into granular details with the need to have large enough groups to calculate meaningful and reliable survival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be working with in this lesson will be the customer churn data set from previous lessons. This data meets all three of our criteria above. It contains an event field (ChurnBinary) that indicates whether or not a customer has churned. It contains a field that represents the passage of time (tenure). And finally, it contains several categorical fields by which we can group customers so that we can explore their retention rates from different perspectives."
