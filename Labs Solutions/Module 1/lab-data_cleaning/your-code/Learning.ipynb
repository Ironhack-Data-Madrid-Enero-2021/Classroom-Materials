    "When working with data sets, you will find that they often require a bit of cleaning. Whether Pandas originally read the data types incorrectly, records are duplicated, the data contains special characters or missing value, or there are slightly different references to the same entity, every data analyst must know how to clean the data they are working with before analyzing it. In this lesson, you will learn about some of the most common problems that make data messy and methods for correcting those problems and cleaning your data.\n",

For our purposes, let's remove the columns that have more than 10,000 null values in them.

In this process, the act of dropping duplicated records is easy, but identifying the correct attributes for comparison and which records to drop is sometimes quite challenging.\n",
