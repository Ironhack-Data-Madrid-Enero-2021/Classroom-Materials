    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant part of programming involves dealing with errors and exceptions. Beginner Python programmers might initially find errors annoying - constantly reminding you that you did something wrong and presenting you with obstacles in your quest for a solution that works. However, as you progress from beginner to intermediate, you will start to increasingly rely on error messages to write better code. You will learn to view errors and exceptions more as a form of communication that informs you about what is wrong with the code you are writing and where the error is occurring.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will familiarize ourselves with the different types of errors and exceptions we might encounter in the Python code we write, learn how to write exceptions into our own code, and learn how to handle errors in different ways.\n",
    "Python Error Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of errors in Python, but below are a few common error types that you are likely to encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SyntaxError: When code has been typed incorrectly.\n",
    "    AttributeError: When you try to access an attribute on an object that does not exist.\n",
    "    KeyError: When you try to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist.\n",
    "    TypeError: When an argument to a function is not of the right type (e.g. a str instead of int).\n",
    "    ValueError: When an argument to a function is of the right type but is not in the right domain (e.g. an empty string)\n",
    "    ImportError: When an import fails.\n",
    "    IOError: When Python cannot access a file correctly on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to letting you know the type of error, Python will also provide an error message that tells you specifically why you are receiving the error.\n",
    "Reading Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "When you encounter an error in Python, there will be a Traceback that informs you of where the error occurs."
