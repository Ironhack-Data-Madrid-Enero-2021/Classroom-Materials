    "Lesson Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "    Learn the difference between procedural and functional programming style.\n",
    "    Learn about the components of functions and how to write them in Python.\n",
    "    Learn the difference between global and local variables and how they apply to functions.\n",
    "    Learn how to apply functions to Pandas data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point, we have been writing Python code in a procedural manner and using functions and methods that are either in Python's standard library or part of some other library such as Numpy or Pandas. This has worked fine for us thus far, but in order to truly graduate from beginner to intermediate Python programmer, you must have a basic understanding of functional programming and be able to write your own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will cover how to write Python code in a functional style and how to construct and call user-defined functions.\n",
    "Procedural vs. Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural code is code that is written line by line and executed in the order it is written. It is the style in which most people learn to program due to its straightforward sequence of actions to solve a problem - do this, then do this, then do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "More mature programmers frame problems a little differently. They take more of a functional approach to problem solving, where they create functions consisting of multiple lines of code that accomplish some task and often return a result that can be used by another function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a function as a tool - something that helps you perform a job. In a sense, functional programming allows you to create your own tools. Some of these tools will be designed specifically for the current set of tasks you need to perform while other functions you write will be more general and able to be used for other projects. Imagine if a chef were able to construct their own set of knives or a carpenter were able to construct their own set of saws that were perfect for the jobs they needed to perform. That is the power that functional programming gives you as a programmer. Over time, you will develop a personal library of functions that allow you to get your work done more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions in Python are defined by the def keyword followed by the function name and one or more inputs the function will need enclosed in parentheses. Within the function, you write code that performs the task you want the function to execute followed by a return statement if there is anything you would like the function to return. Below is an example of a list2string function that converts lists to strings. "

    "Global vs. Local Variables\n",

    "When writing functional code, it is important to keep track of which variables are global and which variables are local. Global variables are variables that maintain their value outside of functions. Local variables maintain their value within the function where they are defined and then cease to exist after we exit that function. In the example below, the variables a and c are global variables and variable b is a local variable that does not exist outside of the multiply function. "

However, now that the function has completed its job, we receive an error when we try to print b because it does not exist in the global variable namespace. "
