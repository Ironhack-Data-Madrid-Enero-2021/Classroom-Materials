    "From the Machine Learning perspective, a dataset represents a set of observations. Every observation in the dataset is represented by a row. Each row contains a number of columns or features. For example, in an application of financial credit assignment, every consumer applying for a loan is an observation in our dataset, and each observation is described by features such as age, marital status, amount of dependent persons, employment status, yearly income, etc. We would then generate a classification algorithm that would return a decision on whether we should approve a loan for each customer.\n",
    "Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, feature engineering is the task of deciding how to represent an observation. There may be many features available, but all of them may not be necessarily useful. For instance, in our example credit application, the favorite refrigerator color of the consumer would not be relevant, and thus we would not include it in our list of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will use the Kaggle Census dataset to demonstrate the data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will load the dataset using Pandas and look at the first five rows using the head function. "

Typically we take a discrete or continuous variable and transform it into a categorical variable by dividing the range into bins. For example, we might take a variable describing income and divide it into 3 bins - low income, medium income, and high income. Doing this comes with a cost of information loss. We simplify the variable but we have now lost information about each person's income.\n",

    "We have mentioned in previous lessons that machine learning seeks to balance predictive power and information loss. Creating more complex models can be computationally expensive. Therefore, it is our goal to create a simple model while sacrificing as little information as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Correlated Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and important way to reduce variables is by removing correlated features. In performing feature selection, we want to avoid highly correlated features and dependent features. The reason is that adding one new highly correlated or dependent feature to the instance representation does not provide new information the Machine Learning can leverage, and it has the disadvantage of unnecessarily complicating the learning process and the resulting model. In our example, if we already have a yearly income feature, it may be redundant to include a fixed monthly income feature.\n",
