    "\n",
    "In this guided lesson, we will analyze an unsupervised learning problem from start to finish and introduce several different processing techniques.\n",

    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist or analyst, you may be asked open ended question about a dataset. One example is to find some patterns in a dataset that is unlabeled. Typically, this happens when analyzing a group of customers and trying to find a common themes between the transactions. The leading choice of algorithm for this type of problem is an unsupervised algorithm. Specifically, this lesson will be using clustering to analyze this problem. In this lesson, we will be analyzing a log of transactions from a bakery to make recommendations about the marketing and sale of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will be analyzing comes from Kaggle and is a log of transactions from a bakery in Edinburgh called The Bread Basket. We will start by evaluating the types of the variables in the data as well as the contents of the categorical variables and the distribution of the numerical variables. "

    "As we can see from these three functions, we have 4 columns in the dataset. The date and time are separated into two columns and stored as text. This means we will have to combine and convert them later on. The transaction variable is ordinal, so the summary statistics really have no meaning in this context. The only meaningful information from the describe function is the max which tells us we have 9684 transactions in the dataset. From the head function, we see that each row represents an item in the transaction. This means that there are potentially multiple items per transaction or maybe just one. We might benefit from consolidating the data and creating a new dataset that contains one row per transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the data we have is a breakdown of each item in a transaction and the date and time when the transaction occurred. The data we do not have is any information about the customer. Since we cannot associate the transactions back to customers, we cannot tell if a certain customer is a regular who comes in and buys a coffee and a pastry every day or whether a customer is a tourist who came in once and bought a specialty dessert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy to make sense of the dataset will be to generate derived variables from this transaction log and cluster based on these derived variables. We will evaluate the aggregate information regarding each cluster and make recommendations about which products to advertise and which products should be in stock and at what days and times.\n",

However, we can even find differences between customer behavior at 7 am vs. at 9 am. Similarly, we see differences between weekday and weekend customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To examine the date and time, we must reformat this variable. We start by combining the date and time into one column and then transforming the column to a datetime column. This allows us to extract the hour and the time of day."

We have items for kids like juice and pouches. We also have non food items like gift vouchers and t-shirts. Another group of items that we can notice is ready to eat snacks like popcorn and crisps. With a bit of work, we can narrow it down from 95 products to 11 categories: beverage, other, kids, snacks, bread, breakfast pastry, dessert, condiments, breakfast, lunch, and other foods. The last group is used to classify mostly uncommon items that sell very little (like polenta) or have names that are hard to identify (like \"Hack the Stack\").\n",

Therefore, our best option is to transform the data using principal component analysis or PCA. What PCA does is project our data onto a lower dimensional subspace. The new data will typically reduce the dimensions of our original data and will therefore, contain less variables. The first dimension will explain the most amount of variation in the data and subsequent components will explain less and less variation. This transformation will provide us with a smaller amount of continuous variables that we can cluster more effectively.\n",
